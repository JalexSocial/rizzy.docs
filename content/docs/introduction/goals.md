The primary objective of our project is to enhance the MVC framework by supplementing the View portion with Razor Components while leveraging HTMX for dynamic content loading. Our goal is to introduce a lightweight library that complements rather than replaces the existing MVC framework. Below are the detailed goals structured to guide our development process:

## 1. Lightweight Library Extension
- **Objective**: Create a library that extends the MVC framework without the need for completely replacing existing infrastructure. MVC is a very mature and stable platform with a massive amount of third-party tools, integrations, and support and this needs to be recognized.

## 2. Razor Component Views Integration
- **Objective**: Develop a Controller implementation that utilizes Razor Components as views, replacing traditional Razor Views. This aims to leverage the component-based architecture of Razor Components within the MVC pattern.  

## 3. HTMX and Razor Components Synergy
- **Objective**: Ensure that Razor Components designed for use within MVC can operate effectively with HTMX, enabling partial page updates and dynamic content loading without full page refreshes.

## 4. Flexible Service Integration for Dynamic Content
- **Objective**: Develop a suite of reusable services designed to facilitate interaction between the application's backend logic and Razor Component Views. This includes the capability for any part of the application to inject new content directly into the current page.

## 5. Enhance Documentation and Examples
- Provide comprehensive documentation and real-world examples demonstrating how to integrate the new library into existing MVC applications, covering common use cases and best practices.

## 6. Community and Feedback Loop
- Establish a community feedback mechanism to continually improve the library based on real-world use cases and developer experiences.
